# linearregression
my first machine learning program (0 use case, just made this to better understand machine learning)

data set used: https://data.world/anujonthemove/auto-insurance-in-sweden/     
1st column = x     
2nd column = y    

linear regression (machine-learning explanation) here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYPUhge9w5c     

#### warning: This program is extremely slow.

You can set the learning rate and the number of steps inside the program.
